Those are the .config files that make up my complete desktop
configuration. Minimalism is key here, so you wont find a lot of fancy
stuff here.

The .bashrc is mostly scavenged from all over the place and doesn't
get much love.

The .xmonad is pretty lean and comes with a scratchpad, and keybinds
for mpc.

The whole color theme of the desktop is zenburn, maybe I'll add a
solaris config and some way to switch it on "system wide".

As the .emacs.d was getting increasingly large and interdependent it
has been factored out into a single independent repository composed of
several git-submodules and my own code.
